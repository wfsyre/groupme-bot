1. A new member who is not yet in the database will cause an error when they are mentioned in a workout post (!gym @new_person)
    Solved by using !reteam
2. An edited workout post should not re-add people who were in the original post (eg. gym !Boezi -> !gym @Boezi @Cate should only add Cate)
    currently it adds Boezi again and Cate
3. Some slack IDs are 11 digits instead of the old 9
